Some major problems I faced were:
Understanding how frontend and backend communicate
Managing authentication state across pages
Handling real-time messages without refreshing the page
Socket.IO events not triggering correctly
MongoDB queries returning unexpected results

Initially, messages were not appearing instantly, and sometimes chats were duplicated. Fixing these issues required debugging and understanding the logic deeply.


Problems I faced:
Messages were sent but not received
Wrong users were getting messages
Socket rooms were confusing at first
Through debugging, I learned:
Each user must join a room using their user ID
Each chat must have its own room
Events like setup, join chat, and new message must be handled carefully
Why socket connections should be initialized only once
After fixing these issues, the chat started working smoothly in real time.

 Future Scope
In the future, this project can be improved by:
Adding group chat functionality
Implementing file and image sharing
Showing online/offline user status
Improving UI responsiveness
Adding message read receipts
Adding icons on the profile pages
adding chat input emojis 

Overall this project was good learning experience for me with websocket and socket.io.
